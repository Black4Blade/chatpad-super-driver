#summary General guide to installing and using the super chatpad driver.


= Introduction =

This is a basic guide to installing and using the chatpad driver.  For now, this is an alpha release so the install and uninstall process are rough.  Do not try the driver right now unless you are comfortable testing alpha software.  :)

This software is provided with no guarantees.  See the [License] wiki page for license information.

  * This software is open-source, but I have not yet finished uploading everything to this project page due to lack of time and upcoming Christmas vacation.  If you are uncomfortable installing software without source, please wait until I upload the files.
  * This software currently only works with WIRED 360 controllers.  It may only currently work with the "Made for Windows" variant but that should change soon to support normal XBox 360 console controllers as well.
  * This software currently contains unsigned kernel drivers.  You must enable the use of unsigned drivers if you are using 64-bit Windows Vista or Windows 7.
  * This software is used at your own risk if you play games protected by the VAC (Valve anti-cheat) system.  This software does not mess with anything in Steam folders, does not replace DLLs, does not hook calls to DLLs, and does not communicate with games at all except by providing keyboard and mouse virtual HID devices to the operating system.  It is my belief that this should be safe, and the VAC FAQ ([https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7849-Radz-6869]) mentions that system drivers should not trigger a VAC ban.  I am using the software myself as a gesture of good faith, and I play VAC-protected games.  Nevertheless, Valve provides no way to verify whether particular software is safe, so do not use the software if you are worried about this.  As long as the control utility is not running, the virtual keyboard and mouse devices should not even generate events.

* WARNING!!!  THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE!  IF YOU ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH MESSING WITH DEVICE MANAGER OR DRIVERS, WAIT FOR A LATER RELEASE! *

  * In the currently released binary, only Windows Vista 64-bit (and MAYBE Windows 7 64-bit) systems are supported.  In addition there may be an Intel/AMD issue.  I need to build a bunch more binaries tomorrow to support more OS variants.  This is not hard, but it takes a little bit of time.
  * If you are using Windows Vista 64-bit or Windows 7 64-bit versions, you will need to first restart your system and press F8 right after the BIOS information goes away to get a boot menu.  Choose the option shown here:<br/>[http://img390.imageshack.us/img390/4326/ddsecc9.png]  <br/>You will need to choose that option with each boot for 64-bit systems, until we potentially get a kernel signing certificate.
